# ig-typedoc-theme
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IgniteUI/igniteui-typedoc-theme.svg?branch=master)

---
**Note**
In order to use this version of the theme, your project needs to have [typedoc-plugin-localization](https://github.com/IgniteUI/typedoc-plugin-localization) as a dependency, because of the localization of some hardcoded template strings.
---

The package provides the feel and look of the [Ignite UI for Angular](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular) API typedoc documentation.

The output could be seen on [this web app](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/docs/typescript/latest/)
