# igniteui-typedoc-theme
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IgniteUI/igniteui-typedoc-theme.svg?branch=master)

This package represents the feel and look of the infragistics [API typedoc documentations](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/docs/typescript/latest/).
There are a specific global header and footer declarations that could be easily edited based on user's preferences.
The theme does not contain localization options and it is not adapted to the [Typedoc plugin localization](https://github.com/IgniteUI/typedoc-plugin-localization).


Example: This theme is used by other documentations within (or external) of the Infragistics organization - e.g. Reveal API documentation. Using of the theme externaly is also possible.
